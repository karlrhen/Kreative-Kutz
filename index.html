        We're your barbers in Belleville!

        At Kreative Kutz, we mix old-school client service with the appeal of young, talented staff in a high energy barbershop environment. Kreative Kutz's stylists and barbers are encouraged to display their individuality from their personal fashion and hairstyles, to taste in music. No shop is quite like ours, as we provide an experience unmatched to any other. 
        </br></br>
        At Kreative Kutz, our approach is to keep services simple, providing quality cuts, shaves, and styles to the masses with our reasonable pricing model. With cuts ranging in prices, our brand delivers a fresh haircut at a value price.  To top it all off, every client’s experience is complete with our complimentary hair wash.
        </br></br>
        Walk-in service is popular, but clients can also request online to be put on a wait list (just like in restaurants), or schedule on the day they’d like to come in and make a reservation with their favorite stylist or barber.   Appointments are recommended, though, for those wanting face and head shaves and coloring services. Clients can even check out individual stylist and barber schedules on our website.  
        </br></br>
        Kreative Kutz Barbershop most importantly represents great business in practice.  Visit us to see why!

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    Kutz online is a scheduling solution for barbers and their customers.  Barbers and their clients can schedule, and manage, haircut appointments in real-time, anytime and anywhere. This will eliminate the process of manually texting or calling to schedule a haircut appointment, on the part of barbers and their customers.
                </br></br>
                    It's simple: in a few steps, you can schedule your appointment! Simply click to schedule your appointment, select your barber, and request one of his openings.  For those unfamiliar with our barbers, there's a tab specifically to display some of barber's awesome cuts.  It's your haircut, why wait? Cut down the time to get your cut and book your appointment!</p>
